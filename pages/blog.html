            <h3>Intro to the war</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            The French invasion of Russia, also known as the Russian campaign, the Second Polish War, the Army of Twenty
            nations, and the Patriotic War of 1812 was launched by Napoleon Bonaparte to force the Russian Empire back
            into the continental blockade of the United Kingdom. Napoleon's invasion of Russia is one of the best
            studied military campaigns in history and is listed among the most lethal military operations in world
            history.[18] It is characterized by the massive toll on human life: in less than six months nearly a million
            soldiers and civilians died.[19][17]

            <h3>Start of the war </h3>
        </header>
        <p>On 24 June 1812 and the following days, the first wave of the multinational Grande Armée crossed the Niemen
            into Russia. Through a series of long forced marches, Napoleon pushed his army of almost half a million
            people rapidly through Western Russia, now Belarus, in an attempt to destroy the separated Russian armies of
            Barclay de Tolly and Pyotr Bagration who amounted to around 180,000–220,000 at this time.[20][21] Within six
            weeks, Napoleon lost half of the men because of the extreme weather conditions, disease and hunger, winning
            just the Battle of Smolensk.</p>

            <h3>Reatreat from Russia</h3>
        </header>
        <p>As the Tsar refused to respond, and because of the beautiful weather, Napoleon stayed too long. On 19
            October, after five weeks of occupation, the army left Moscow. The army still numbered 108,000 men, but his
            cavalry had been nearly destroyed. With horses exhausted or dead, commanders redirected cavalrymen into
            infantry units, leaving French forces helpless against Cossack fighters intensifying the guerilla warfare.
            With little direction or supplies, the army turned to leave the region, struggling on toward worse
            disaster.[146] Napoleon followed the old Kaluga road southwards towards unspoilt, richer parts of Russia to
            use other roads for retreat westwards to Smolensk than the one being scorched by his own army for the march
            eastwards.[147] Napoleon's goal was to get around Kutuzov, but he was stopped at Maloyaroslavets on his way
            to Medyn in the West.</p>
